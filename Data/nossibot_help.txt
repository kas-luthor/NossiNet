Welcome to the Nosferatu Robot Servant!
General behaviour:
    newlines: are treated as separate inputs for normal commands.
    // : starts a comment, the rest of the line is repeated in the output but otherwise ignored
    def : will define a replacement that is from then on applied to all your messages before (and during) processing
        example: def a = 10
        result: every occurence "a" will be replaced by 10
        SPECIAL DEF VALUES:
            difficulty: standard difficulty for threshholds/ for e and f
            onebehaviour: 0 if standard is "e", 1 if standard is "f"
            sides: how many sides dice have if nothing is said
            return: standard returnfunctions threshhold, sum, min, max, id, None
        if no = is specified, the value of the rest of the line will be looked up for you
             example: def a
             result: 10
    undef : will remove a defined replacement
        example: undef a
        result: a will no longer be replaced by anything
    def=? : will show all defined values
    ? will try to give you a more detailed error message. after oracle for oracle help or first thing for rolls
    #remind prefix is currently not even working and WILL spam you do death with no way to stop it except muting if you use it
Available commands:
NossiBot : prefix for the most meta of things, assumed in DMs
    Subcommands:
        help : this help!
        INVOKE : makes NossiBot listen to the Textchannel in which this was said
        BANISH : makes NossiBot stop listening, does not work in DMs.
weapon: : prefix for the fen weapon parser
    usage:
        weapon:X will get the table for the weapon X from http://nosferatu.vampir.es/wiki/weapons
        weapon:X:M will also apply the modifier M, see http://nosferatu.vampir.es/wiki/modifiers
        magicalweapon:X:P will try to fill in the codes from http://nosferatu.vampir.es/wiki/magicalweapons
                P is the Parameter to be filled in to <formulas>.
                they can be given in the format key:value or just as values. Order SHOULD be from left to right but
                testing is advised. Delimiter is ","
        example:  magicalweapon:blitzsäbel:roll:13,res7:0  this uses exact names
                  magicalweapon:glassäbel:13 this tries to match names to the parameters in the order they are used
oracle : prefix for selector system standard 5 dice (+modifiers) roll graphs
    it expects a list of at least 2 integers as a parameter. the last one is the bonus/malusdice, all previous are selectors
    Subcommand:
        show : will make the graph as a picture with quantiles. number of quantiles is new last parameter, rest as normal

Unprefixed messages are passed to the diceroller:
Examplerolls:
3,2@5 rolls 5 dice (standard is 10 sides) and selects the 3rd and 2nd smallest
3d6 rolls 3 six sided dice
69d420s rolls 69 420 sided dice and sorts them before displaying
6v v is automatically replaced with &verbose& which leads to a bit more output!
10h;10l;10g rolls 3 rolls, and selects highest lowest and sum respectively
3f8 threshhold 8, so only 8 and higher counts, and WoD botch rules apply
3e4 counts dice above 4
&loop 3g 9& rolls 9 times the sum of 3 10 sided dice
&loopsum 3g 9& also adds those together
aaand probably some more
